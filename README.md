# Python-Hangman
Hangman Game This is a simple implementation of the classic game Hangman using Python 3. The objective of the game is to guess a secret word by suggesting letters within a certain number of attempts.

To start the game, run:
```
python hangman.py
```
The game will prompt you to enter a secret word to guess. Once you have entered a letter, the game will begin and display the number of letters in the secret word as underscores.

You can then guess individual letters by entering them one at a time. If the letter is correct, it will be revealed in the secret word; otherwise, you will lose an attempt. Losing an attempt will visually show as Hangman body parts. The game ends when you either guess the entire word correctly or run out of attempts.
